Randomizer
==========
A single-page webapp that takes a list of choices, flips through them in a random order, and shows a final random choice.

Enter your list of options, click to start, and then optionally click on the final choice to run the Randomizer again.

Great for deciding where to eat, picking who to put in your will, or choosing what to name your child!
